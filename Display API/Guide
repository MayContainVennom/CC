-- API MANUAL:
 For now this is going to only have the functions and how they need to be called. Later down the line I may add more detail and senarios where the functions can be used.

 Functions:
 ----------

- Text:
	This function can be called with display.text(monitorID,fileID,textSize). It allows for file output's to monitor's.

- Paint:
	This function can be called with display.paint(monitorID,fileID) allowing you to display a CC paint file on the monitor. Note that the image start location is 1,1.

- Time:
	This function can be called with display.time(monitorID,textSize,timeZone) working with "GMT" and "EST" as the timezones. It pulls the time and date within these timezones.

- Reset:
	This function can be called with display.reset(monitorID) allowing the monitor to be completly cleared. Note that all of the above functions have this already running.
